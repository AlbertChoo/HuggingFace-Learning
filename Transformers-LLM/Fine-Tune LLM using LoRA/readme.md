## Main Components:

1. Dependencies & Model Setup
- Installs datasets and trl (Transformer Reinforcement Learning).
- Imports AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, and LoraConfig from peft.

2. Dataset & Tokenizer
- Loads a dataset using Hugging Face datasets.
- Prepares tokenization for training.

3. Model Configuration
- Loads a pre-trained LLM.
- Sets up LoRA configuration for efficient training.

4. Fine-Tuning Process
- Uses SFTTrainer from trl for Supervised Fine-Tuning.
